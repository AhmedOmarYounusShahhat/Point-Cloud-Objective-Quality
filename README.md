# Point-Cloud-Objective-Quality

Some Notes for users :

1-Here You can find simple software to use to calculate the objective quality of the point cloud dataset .
2-The matrixes used are D1-MSE and CMSE quality matrixes .
3-The way of calculation is simplified to have faster way of calculating the quality .
4-the calculation is based on using random points and take the mean of them rather than calculating the hole dataset.
5-this can save a lot of time for researchers and students to make the calculation faster .
6-it is proven to be effeicent to check the quality for algorithms that have been applied for the hole dataset rather than just one part of it.
7-To make it simple for non python users the code is written to work on colab https://colab.research.google.com/ which is free server that you use without installing anything .
8- If you want to use it on your local pc you could get errors as some libraries are colab libraries .
